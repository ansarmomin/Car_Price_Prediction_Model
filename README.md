# Car_Price_Prediction_Model
ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This Car Price Prediction project uses machine learning to estimate the selling price of a used car based on features such as the carâ€™s name, fuel type, year, engine, mileage, cylinders, drivetrain etc. The model is trained using a regression algorithm (Random Forest Regressor) to provide accurate price predictions. This project demonstrates the complete pipeline of a data science projectâ€”from data preprocessing to model building and evaluationâ€”implemented in Python.
